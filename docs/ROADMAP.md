# Roadmap

## 🚧 What Is Left To Do

### High Priority Features

#### 1. **Admin Dashboard** 🔴

**Status:** Not Started  
**Description:** Create an admin panel to manage users and view system-wide analytics

**Tasks:**

- [ ] Create admin authentication check
- [ ] Build admin layout component
- [ ] User management page (view all users, delete users, change roles)
- [ ] System analytics dashboard (total users, tasks, active users)
- [ ] Audit logs viewer

---

#### 2. **Enhanced Data Visualization & Analytics** 🟡

**Status:** Planning Phase  
**Description:** Implement interactive dashboards with React charts and optional Python analytics for advanced insights

##### **Phase 1: Frontend Data Visualization (React/Next.js)** 🎯 **Recommended**

**Recommended Library:** **Recharts** or **Tremor**

**Why React Libraries:**
- ✅ Seamless integration with existing React/TypeScript stack
- ✅ Interactive, real-time charts perfect for dashboards
- ✅ No additional backend infrastructure needed
- ✅ Works with current Node.js/Express API
- ✅ Vercel deployment compatible

**Library Options:**

**Option A: Recharts** (Top Pick for General Charts)
```bash
pnpm install recharts
```
- **Best for:** Dashboard statistics, trend analysis
- **Pros:** Simple API, highly customizable, responsive, TypeScript support
- **Use cases:** Task completion trends, points progression, streak history

**Option B: Tremor** (Top Pick for Analytics Dashboards)
```bash
pnpm install @tremor/react
```
- **Best for:** Modern analytics dashboards
- **Pros:** Beautiful pre-built components, Tailwind CSS integration
- **Use cases:** Admin analytics, KPI cards with integrated charts

**Option C: Chart.js with react-chartjs-2**
```bash
pnpm install chart.js react-chartjs-2
```
- **Best for:** Traditional charts (bar, line, pie, doughnut)
- **Pros:** Most popular, extensive documentation, plugin ecosystem
- **Use cases:** General-purpose charts across the application

**Implementation Tasks:**

- [ ] **Install chart library** (Recharts recommended)
- [ ] **User Dashboard Charts:**
  - [ ] Weekly completion trend graph (line chart)
  - [ ] Monthly completion trend graph (area chart)
  - [ ] Points progression chart (line chart with gradient)
  - [ ] Streak history visualization (bar chart)
  - [ ] Task distribution by priority (pie/donut chart)
  - [ ] Task completion rate by day of week (bar chart)
- [ ] **Admin Dashboard Charts:**
  - [ ] Platform-wide user activity (heatmap)
  - [ ] User engagement trends (multi-line chart)
  - [ ] Task completion statistics (stacked bar chart)
- [ ] **Interactive Features:**
  - [ ] Hover tooltips with detailed stats
  - [ ] Date range selectors
  - [ ] Export chart as image
  - [ ] Filter by task category/priority
- [ ] **Yearly Heatmap:**
  - [ ] GitHub-style contribution calendar
  - [ ] Color intensity based on completion percentage
  - [ ] Click on date to view details

##### **Phase 2: Python Analytics Microservice (Advanced)** 🚀 **Optional Enhancement**

**When to Add Python:**
- ⚠️ You want **advanced statistical analysis** and **ML predictions**
- ⚠️ You need **automated PDF report generation** (weekly/monthly emails)
- ⚠️ You require **heavy data processing** before visualization
- ⚠️ You plan to offer **premium analytics features**

**What Python Can Do:**

**1. Advanced Statistical Analysis**
- Streak prediction (predict when users will break streaks)
- Anomaly detection (sudden productivity drops)
- Time series forecasting (future completion rates)
- User segmentation (cluster users by behavior patterns)
- Correlation analysis (task difficulty vs completion)

**2. Predictive Machine Learning**
- Predict task completion probability
- Recommend optimal task load per user
- Identify best time-of-day for task completion
- Suggest task priority adjustments

**3. Complex Data Aggregations**
- Multi-dimensional reports (by hour/day/week/month/category)
- Cross-user analytics (team performance comparisons)
- Cohort analysis (user groups over time)
- Consistency score algorithms with exponential weighting

**4. Automated Report Generation**
- Weekly PDF reports emailed to users
- Monthly performance summaries with charts
- Custom admin reports (CSV, Excel, PDF)

**Recommendation:** Start with **Phase 1 (React Charts)** for immediate value. Add **Phase 2 (Python)** later if you need ML predictions, automated reports, or advanced analytics as premium features.
